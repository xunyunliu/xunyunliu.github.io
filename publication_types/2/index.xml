      <description>Abstract
Data stream management systems (DSMSs) are scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems that aggregate and analyze real-time data in motion. To continuously perform analytics on the fly within the stream, state-of-the-art DSMSs host streaming applications as a set of inter-connected operators, with each operator encapsulating the semantic of a specific operation. For parallel execution on a particular platform, these operators need to be appropriately replicated in multiple instances that split and process the workload simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Performance-Oriented Deployment of Streaming Applications on Cloud</title>

      <description>Abstract
Performance of streaming applications are significantly impacted by the deployment decisions made at infrastructure level, i.e., number and configuration of resources allocated for each functional unit of the application. The current deployment practices are mostly platform-oriented, meaning that the deployment configuration is tuned to a static resource-set environment and thus is inflexible to use in cloud with an on-demand resource pool. In this paper, we propose P-Deployer, a deployment framework that enables streaming applications to run on IaaS clouds with satisfactory performance and minimal resource consumption.</description>
